Created vector embeddings for the issues retrieved and stored them in ElasticSearch (Push, Pull, and Readme directories)
1) Created a Bar Chart to plot the number of issues created for every repo for every day of the week; that is total number of issues created on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday â€¦, Sunday for EVERY Repo name.
2)Used vector embeddings, score, and semantic search to identify and list the Top 5 most similar issues for every repo listed above.
